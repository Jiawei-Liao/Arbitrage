# Arbitrage
Find betting arbitrage trades. It does work but not very well since I used a free API.

# Usage
1. Open index.html with live server
2. Go to [here](https://the-odds-api.com/) to get a free API
3. Put it into API key text box or into index.js configAPI variable
4. Select sports you want to find arbitrages in
5. Click "Get Matches" and hopefully there will be one available
6. Game, teams, profit, bets and companies are listed for you to make the bets
